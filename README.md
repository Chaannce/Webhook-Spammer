# Webhook-Spammer
A discord webhook spammer I made when I was bored. Yes, I know I could save tons of lines by making the url a universal string. I am just very picky and like to work on a certain display lol. Welcome to any forks, please only use this on people who use discord webhooks for malware. I did this with the intent of only getting payback for people scamming/giving malware to people.


# Want Even More Customisation?
To make a even more customised webhook? You can change the payload!

Don't know how to customise the payload? No problem, go to https://discord.com/developers/docs/resources/webhook and scroll down a bit. On the docs you will see the fields you can add to the payload!


# Message Delay
If you end up changing the message delay I recommend setting the lowest to 750, I did a 5 minute timer between 750ms and 1000ms to see which was faster.

Results Of The 5 Minute Test

```
750ms - 170 messages sent
1000ms - 174 messages sent
```
